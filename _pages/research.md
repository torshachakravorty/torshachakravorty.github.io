## Brokers in public service delivery
*Ongoing*

This project addresses a key challenge in identifying and understanding informal markets. Using confidential administrative data, I study the role of brokers in delivery of public services in places with weak state capacity. Broker markets can arise anywhere on the spectrum of informal fiscal capacity to rent-seeking entities. I document faster processing of brokered applications and correlations between broker presence and application volume. Using a shift-share instrument for exogenous movements in state capacity, I find that the broker premium in processing time converges to zero in response to increases in state capacity. This is driven significantly by non-brokered applications.

## Highways and Innovation in India (with Ishani Chatterjee)
*Ongoing*

In this project, we document higher district-level patenting activity with increasing access to road transport networks in India. We explore mechanisms behind this and observe the growth of higher educational institutions, and well as increasing firm size measured by authorized capital, in response to increasing highway exposure at the district level. Newer and smaller firms are seen to come up in districts that are farther away, which suggests spatial spillovers into districts farther away from national highway networks.
